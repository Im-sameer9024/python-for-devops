You'll finish Choice Hacking feeling confident and ready to transform your experience with science. In Choice Hacking, you'll discover: - How to make sure your customer experience is designed for what people do (not what they say they'll do) - How to increase the odds that customers will make the \"right choice\" in any environment - How to design user experiences that drive action and engagement - How to create retail experiences that persuade and drive brand love - How brands like Uber, Netflix, Disney, and Starbucks apply these principles in their customer and user experiences Additional resources included with the book: - Access to free video Companion Course - Access to exclusive free resources, tools, examples, and use cases online Who will benefit from reading Choice Hacking?
